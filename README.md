### Connor Ludwig

Hello, I'm a Software Engineer at John Deere working on Embedded Licensing Enablement, focused on delivering a seamless customer experience for new Embedded Software purchases.

I live in Chicago, Illinois and outside of work love diving into a good book, keeping up with my favorite teams, and searching for the best food around.

I'm passionate about using technology to overcome key pain points for customers. I'm always learning new tools and tech to improve my workstyle and help deliver a better product.
